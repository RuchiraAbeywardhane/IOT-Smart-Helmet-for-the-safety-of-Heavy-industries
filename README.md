# IOT Smart Helmet for the safety of Heavy industries
An IoT Smart Helmet for heavy industries enhances worker safety by integrating sensors and communication systems to monitor environmental conditions and health metrics in real-time. It detects hazards like toxic gases, high temperatures, and worker fatigue, sending alerts to prevent accidents. Equipped with GPS and accelerometers, it also tracks worker location and detects falls, ensuring a proactive, data-driven approach to industrial safety.
